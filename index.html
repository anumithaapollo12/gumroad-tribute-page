        <p>My journey with Gumroad has been awesome, it changed my perspective on working. I am
            doing what I love and earning from my craft. I have the complete freedom to do anything and at any pace.
            There are tons of other creaotors working on really cool stuff and sell it on Gumroad. Gumroad is changing
            the way people look at working and earning a living.

            Their work culture is something I haven't found in any other company yet! It's so unconventionally awesome,
            it's a dream work culture for me. Flexiblity and freedom in one. A liberating company and product :)
